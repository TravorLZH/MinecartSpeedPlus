Fixing version numbers

13.2
Migration to SpigotAPI

14.0
VehicleMoveEvent fix

15.0.3	
compatibility update for MC1.15+

16.0.3	
stability update
fixed CraftBukkit ignoring the global speed.

17.0.2	
Added support for 1.17, updated mapping and fixed "[msp] fly".
Only tested on Spigot as other forks are not available yet.
Backwards compatibility untested, but should work fine,
please note there is currently cap at speed 4 when dynamically 
changing speed due to some strange minecart behavior that could 
occur when moving faster in versions grater than 1.13, if you 
need faster speed and have an older server version you can 
simply use an older version of this resource.

17.0.3	
This is just a quick update to fix a mistake i made in spelling.

18.0.1	
Migrated from the SpigotAPI to the PaperAPI and replaced all spigot 
packages with their bukkit equivalents for maximum compatibility
Changed the blue text to a more modern style as requested by a multiple users
forced a global minecart speed limit of 4 (forgot to cap global in the last
update)
it is now possible to use decimal numbers for a more specific speed
Fully compatible with Bukkit, Spigot, Paper and all it's forks

19.0.1
Added slow mode for minecarts and debug command

Slow mode is automatically enabled when the minecart is about to ascend or
turn and disabled afterwards. Otherwise, the minecart could be bounced back or
run off track while ascending or turning.

To monitor the status of minecarts' slow mode, type `/mspdebug on'
